# Discord Clone

When you enter this website you can register with your email.

After you register, the site will redirect you to "/app", that is, to the main part of the application.

You can add friends, chat with them, etc. like on a real discord.

You can't add a server though as there is only one main server (I might add the ability for users to create servers in the future).

When you go to the server you can open the sidebar at the top right and you have all the users.

You can click on them and it opens up a div where you have buttons to send messages and if you want to add them.

You can also open that div if you click on a name or profile on messages on the server.

I made this app by using react and firebase.
